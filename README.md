# Senior Project - Dungeon Map Generator

This program will randomly generate a dungeon map.

Created by Silvere Heraudeau.

Requirements:

 - Variable map size (small: 50x50, medium: 75x75, large: 100x100)
 - Variable number of rooms (small: 8 to 12, medium: 14 to 16, large: 22 to 26)
 - Rooms interconnected by hallways so none of them will be left alone.
 - Variable room size (small; 4x4 to 8x8, medium: 5x5 to 12x12, large: 6x6 to 16x16) and shape (square or rectangle)
 - Rooms must not be on the edge of the map.
